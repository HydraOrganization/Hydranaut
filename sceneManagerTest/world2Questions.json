    "Knowing when to use IF/ELSE statements is another important part of writing computer code, no matter which programming language you use. Think of IF/ELSE statements as you wanting your computer program do something only IF a specific condition is met. OTHERWISE the program must do something different if that condition is not there. The OTHERWISE is typically known as ELSE in most programming languages. Look at the following example:\n\n\tIF the planet has a rocky surface then you can land your spaceship on it.\n\tOTHERWISE/ELSE you have to move on to the next planet to explore.\n\nFor this example the planet must have a rocky surface in order for you to be able to land on it. If it is rock then you can land. If it is not, then you would have to move on to the next planet. Boolean expressions (AND, OR, and NOT from the previous lesson) are used to determine the conditions of IF/ELSE statements. Let’s look at another example:\n\n\tIF the planet has a rocky surface AND has an atmosphere,\n\t\tthen you can land on the planet.\n\tELSE,\n\t\tyou must move on to the next planet.\n\nWe’ve used the Boolean operator AND in this example. Here both conditions must be true in order for you to proceed. The planet must be both rocky and have an atmosphere so you can land your spaceship. If either one of these are not true then you would have to move on to the next planet.\n\n"],
